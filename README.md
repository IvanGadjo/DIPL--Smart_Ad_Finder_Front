# Smart_Ad_Finder Frontend

The frontend part of a web app used for scheduling and finding desired adverts. Pazar3.mk and reklama5.mk are one of the biggest ad listing websites in Macedonia. Therefore, the core idea is to have an all-in-one web app that simplifies and automates finding ads on pazar3.mk and reklama5.mk. The user can set keywords, other criteria and a time limit, by which the search will be conducted. When a matching ad is found, it is listed so the user can preview the link. He/She is also able to see all of the collected ads for the current search criterias, but also past searches with the respective found ads.
